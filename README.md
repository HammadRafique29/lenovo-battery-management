# lenovo-battery-management

I use a PM Laptop (Lenovo Core i5-1235U G3) as my primary device with Linux OS, mostly connected to a power adapter since I run high-end tasks. I assumed modern laptops had overcharging protection, so it wouldn’t affect my battery. However, after 6–7 months, I noticed an issue—my battery performance had degraded. When it reaches 30%, it now drains within 15 minutes, whereas previously, it lasted 25–30 minutes.

After researching, I discovered that Lenovo’s Max_Battery_LifeSpan feature is not enabled by default. I found both official Lenovo and third-party extensions to configure the battery settings. I’ve applied the configuration and will share the results soon. I also plan to create a guide to help others be aware of this issue.
